# Compositr

*Work in progress*

```library(compositr)``` is a one stop shop for all your text preprocessing and tokenization needs. The library consists of two functions: ```textprep()``` (which does the work of preprocessing and tokenization) and ```get_austen_data()``` (which provides you with a sample dataset to test the function on, pulled from ```library(janeaustenr)```. 

To install and use this package:
```devtools::install_github("alexlusco/compositr")```
