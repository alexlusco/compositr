# Compositr

*Work in progress*

Library(compositr) is a one stop shop for all your text preprocessing and tokenization needs. The library consists of two functions: ```textprep()``` (which does the work of preprocessing and tokenization) and ```get_austen_data()``` (which provides you with a sample dataset to test the function on, pulled from ```library(janeaustenr)```. 

# # To install and use this package:
